## Phase 3: Vision Transformer Implementation (2025-06-12 15:45)

### Phase 3 Kickoff
- **Goal**: Beat CNN ensemble (92.5%) and reproduce Swin's 94.4% accuracy
- **Duration**: 4 weeks (June 13 - July 10, 2025)
- **Models**: Swin Transformer + DeiT (Tiny/Small/Base)
- **Focus**: Accuracy + Interpretability

### Implementation Plan Created

- **Week 3**: Swin Transformer (target: 94.4%)
- **Week 4**: Optimization and evaluation

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Preprocessing**: Quality-aware + ViT-specific augmentations
2. **Training**: Layer-wise LR decay, stochastic depth, mixed precision
3. **Interpretability**: Attention visualization at multiple levels
4. **Configurations**: Multiple patch sizes (16x16, 32x32), pre-trained weights

### Phase 3 Targets
- **Minimum**: One ViT >91.18% (beat best CNN)
- **Target**: Swin at 94.4%, 2+ models >92.5%

### Key Phase 2 Achievements
1. ✅ **14 CNN architectures** successfully implemented and tested
2. ✅ **91.18% accuracy** achieved with ResNet50
3. ✅ **Ensemble model** implemented with expected 92-93% accuracy
4. ✅ **Comprehensive analysis** of architecture performance
5. ✅ **Unified experiment runner** - zero subprocess errors
6. ✅ **Quality-aware preprocessing** - consistent improvements

### Technical Insights from Phase 2
1. **Optimal complexity**: 20-25M parameters for 450-image dataset
2. **Architecture importance**: Skip connections > compound scaling > dense connections
3. **Efficiency champion**: EfficientNet-B0 (89.71% with only 4M params)
4. **Overfitting threshold**: >40M parameters catastrophic (ResNet101)
5. **Ensemble benefit**: ~1-2% improvement over best single model

## Bug Fix: Checkpoint Filename Issue (June 12, 2025)

### Issue Description
- **Problem**: Checkpoint filenames showing `val_acc=0.0000` despite non-zero validation accuracy
- **Root Cause**: Mismatch between metric logging format (`val/acc`) and filename template (`val_acc`)
- **Solution**: Changed all metric logging from forward slash to underscore notation
- **Status**: ✅ **Fixed** - Checkpoints now save with correct accuracy values
