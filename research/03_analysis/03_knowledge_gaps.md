# Knowledge Gaps in NLOM Thyroid Preprocessing

## Critical Research Needs
1. **Thyroid-Specific Parameters**
   - Lack of published CLAHE parameters optimized for thyroid follicles
   - Unknown normalization bounds for pathological vs healthy tissue

2. **Multiphoton Artifacts**
   - Limited solutions for photobleaching correction in 3D stacks
   - No standardized methods for motion artifact correction

3. **Validation Benchmarks**
   - Absence of public NLOM thyroid datasets with ground truth
   - No established quality metrics for thyroid follicle imaging

## Implementation Challenges
1. **Computational Efficiency**
   - Real-time preprocessing requirements for intraoperative imaging
   - GPU acceleration of 3D CLAHE

2. **PyTorch Integration**
   - Limited native support for advanced microscopy transforms
   - Custom op development requirements

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Dynamic parameter tuning based on image content
   - Quality-aware pipeline configuration
